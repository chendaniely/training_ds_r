This is a training manual that was built on top of the minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).

Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/

This project is a fork from a project in my old lab: https://github.com/bi-sdal/training/blob/master/.gitignore
