"Looking for the ""Herbal"" in Herbalife",Dietary supplements; Manufacturers; Financial services; Business models; Investment policy,"Name: Herbalife Ltd; NAICS: 325411, 325412, 424490",Institutional Investor; New York,1/1/13,"Business And Economics--Investments, Business And Economics--Banking And Finance",Trade Journals,General Information,"Nutritional supplement maker Herbalife has been busily defending its business model against short sellers, but investors in Herbalife may want to remember that selling a dream doesn't necessarily pay the rent.Months before the recent Sturm und Drang surrounding nutritional-supplement maker Herbalife, my firm took a long, hard look at the company. On the surface it was a value investor's dream: great balance sheet, high return on capital, high revenue and earnings growth, and attractive valuation. Of course, there was one problem: The validity of its multilevel marketing (MLM) pyramid structure was being questioned by some investors. To my surprise, despite its name, there is little that is ""herbal"" about Herbalife. I thought I'd see a lot of exotic plants reincarnated as wonder miracle supplements. What I discovered is that the majority of Herbalife's sales come from its Formula 1 product, a meal-replacement supplement. If Herbalife's products were sold at Walgreens or GNC, the story would be very simple, but it is not. The company's business model is in question because investors suspect that its products are bought just as ""trading sardines"" (they might as well be bricks or wooden sticks). If at the end of the day its supplements are not consumed but instead rest peacefully in the garages of its distributors, Herbalife is nothing but a Ponzi-like scheme that will run its course -- they always do. Whether they are long or short Herbalife shares, investors have to have a clear answer to one question: Is Herbalife a Ponzi-like scheme? In our research, finding a definitive answer was very difficult. Herbalife is not unlike a typical MLM company that spends most of its time painting a picture of a Ferrari-embellished financial freedom that awaits you just around the corner if you sign up enough distributors to sell its products. Herbalife claims that the bulk of its supplements are consumed on a daily basis at ""clubs,"" of which there are thousands around the world. Clubs are owned and operated by Herbalife distributors and are supposed to be social spots for Herbalife connoisseurs to meet, share their weight-loss war stories and, for about $6, down a shot of Formula 1 and swig some aloe vera juice. We visited a nearby club a few times. What we found is that, though there were a few people replacing their lunch with Formula 1, it was mostly a place for distributors to peddle Herbalife's products to one another. According to the club operator, selling $6 lunch substitutes did not cover operating expenses and rent. It is probably impossible for Herbalife to know for sure how much of its products are consumed at these clubs, but I doubt that it is as much as they claim. If people find that they like these shakes, they can just make them on their own. We could not get comfortable with Herbalife's main product, Formula 1. It has a lot fewer calories than your typical McDonald's meal, but so does a cardboard box. If you keep replacing your lunch with Formula 1, you'll very likely lose weight; but according to a nutritionist friend, if you want to stay healthy, you don't want to consume Formula 1 on a regular basis. Also, Formula 1 is expensive -- after all, lots of layers of distributors above you need to be fed from each sale. Formula 1 reminds me of another product that, without serious financial incentives paid to those who sell it, would probably not exist today (at least not in large quantity): variable annuities. In some stripped-down, inexpensive form, variable annuities might be a good product, albeit one with a very limited market. However, they have been very profitable for financial institutions, which started paying huge commissions (sometimes 10 to 15 percent of the principal value), thus transforming the variable annuity into an expensive financial trap to be forced on the unsophisticated crowd. Similarly, if Herbalife sold its products in stores, or did not try to sell the American dream to its distributors, its products would be much cheaper but its sales would be a fraction of what they are today. A few months after we did our research, Pershing Square Capital Management's Bill Ackman announced his Herbalife short. I watched his presentation with interest. But unlike his other, brilliant presentations, this one left me unimpressed. Ackman's three-hour-plus, 334-slide presentation did not answer the most important question: If Herbalife is a Ponzi-like scheme, why is its business still growing in the U.S. after 32 years? It felt to me as if Ackman so despises what he believes is Herbalife's deception that this short is a quixotic quest to right a perceived wrong. Regardless, in early January, Dan Loeb of Third Point revealed that his fund has an 8 percent stake in Herbalife, calling Ackman's case against the company ""preposterous."" Ackman's highly publicized short may turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy. It will definitely distract management from running the company. It will also increase Herbalife'"
Sanofi proves its pluck,Pharmaceutical industry; Software utilities; Information technology; Corporate profiles; Awards & honors; Research & development--R & D,Name: Sanofi-Aventis SA; NAICS: 325412,Medical Marketing and Media; New York,1/1/13,"Medical Sciences, Pharmacy And Pharmacology, Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing",Trade Journals,Cover Story,"Sanoficame into 2012 staring down at the steepest patent cliffin the industry. Plavix, for which Sanofi's share of 2011 global sales was $2.6 billion, lost US exclusivity in May. Avapro (2011 sales of $1.6 billion) went off-patent in March, and Eloxatin ($1.2 billion) followed in August. Lovenox and Taxotere were already facing generic competition. The company came out of the year bigger than ever-having surpassed oil and gas giant Total as France's largest company, and Pfizer as the world's largest pharma-and emerged better than expected, with full-year earnings projected to fall 12%, as of this writing, rather than the 15% anticipated earlier in the year. Perhaps more importantly, instead of battening down the hatches, Sanofiset the bar for engagement of external audiences, with innovative digital media programs, a groundbreaking gadget and visionary contests aimed at pulling up-and-coming techies, scientists, patient advocates and non-profits into its orbit. What? A giant pharma company getting out and being social, exhibiting a spirit of openness, even hopefulness, as it sloughs offmuch of its old business and reinvents itself? How do you say ""Geddoudaheah"" in French? ""It's been an incredibly tough year,"" concedes Anne Whitaker, president, North America, pharmaceuticals, Sanofi. ""One that people were holding their breath over-would we get past May 17th, when Plavix went offpatent? What would happen when Eloxatin went offpatent in August? The fact that we've come through the year and delivered growth on our North American net sales line-I think a lot of people thought that wasn't possible."" Sanofi's North American oper- ations account for 18,000 employees and around a third of revenues-just ahead of its business in emerging markets. Net sales for the first nine months of 2012 were up 2.1%-outperforming a worldwide 1.2% uptick. With so many of its big products lapsing into patent oblivion at once, Sanofiis in the process of a root-andbranch reinvention. The company has a promising pipeline and new prod- INucts, like colorectal cancer treatment Zaltrap and MS drug Aubagio, with potential. More importantly, it's got a vision-laid out by CEO Chris Viehbacher. Under Viehbacher, Sanofihas diversified, going from a small-molecule blockbuster pharma model to a mix of biologics, vaccines, generics and OTC products, along with some promising pilots in ""beyond the pill"" tech and services. It's also embraced an outwardfacing culture of ""open innovation"" spanning the breadth of the organization, from marketing to R&D. On the development side, that's taken the form of a pivot away from strict reliance on internal R&D in favor of partnerships with biotech startups, academic researchers and venture capital firms, to name a few. On the marketing front, that's meant less focus on product promotion and more on engagement of patients, physicians and payers, as well as some innova- tive programs drawing in patient advocates, medical societies, techies, government officials and other parties. It's a kind of crowdsourcing writ large-which makes sense coming from a company that, more than its peers, gets social media and feels right at home in the digital world. This is nowhere more apparent than in the company's digital efforts around diabetes, its sole franchise to come through the past few years intact (Sanofisold more than $5 billionworth of Lantus globally in 2011, and sales of the insulin analogue were up 20.7% for the third quarter of 2012). Sanofi's diabetes blog (Discuss Diabetes), Twitter feed (@Diabetes_Sanofi) and Facebook page (facebook.com/ SanofiUSDiabetes) are kept up by Community Manager Laura Kolodjeski, who has lent the company's digital presence personality and a human face. There's also Diabetapedia, a searchable dictionary. It all comes together in The DX, an online diabetes news aggregator curating external content. None of these elements is, by itself, revolutionary, but the comprehensiveness of their approach to social media is farsighted for a pharma company. ""We did this not to find different ways to promote our products, but we really wanted to get a deeper understanding of what are some of the common challenges, opportunities and other things our patients are dealing with,"" says VP and head, US diabetes, SanofiUS, Dennis Urbaniak. ""We quickly understood that the social community aspect is not an advertising channel but a way for a company to get closer to those communities we serve."" Sanofi's outreach extends beyond patients and caregivers. In 2011, the company launched its Data Design Diabetes Innovation Challenge, a contest in which the best ideas for using data and technology to improve patients' lives are rewarded with cash and connections (the company sponsors a similar contest, Collaborate | Activate, for patient advocacy groups). What's in it for Sanofi? Food for thought, and perhaps first pick of some talented up-and-coming techies. This approach to other interested parties in the healthcare"
"Vim, vigor and sales drive",Pharmaceutical industry; Marketing; Awards & honors; Corporate profiles,"Name: Abbott Laboratories; NAICS: 325411, 325412, 325413, 325620, 334516, 339112",Medical Marketing and Media; New York,1/1/13,"Medical Sciences, Pharmacy And Pharmacology, Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing",Trade Journals,Feature,"It might be exaggerating to say that AbbVie-Abbott's new break-out pharma division-overcame a host of challenges to establish AndroGel as the preeminent product in the low-testosterone category. Or maybe not. AbbVie took a taboo topic and, via a cagey media-and-marketing presence, rendered it less wince-inducing among its target audience. It did so at a time when a number of critics voiced their concerns that the marketing and use of testosterone-boosting products had gotten ahead of the science. ""We don't have any evidence that prescribing testosterone to older men with relatively low testosterone levels does any good,"" the National Institute on Aging's Dr. Sergei Romashkan told the AP in September. AndroGel's type of testosterone therapy was approved by the FDA in 2000, but the products still had to contend with a branding challenge: convincing men with low or no testosterone that their condition (known as hypogonadism) wasn't abnormal or anything to be ashamed of. AbbVie and its agencies, which include Digitas Health for consumer and AbelsonTaylor for professional ads, portray low testosterone as ""Low T""-a treatable problem. The campaign's mix of platforms include unbranded promotion (the IsItLowT. com site) and awareness-first TV spots. In 2012, an ad touted AndroGel's more concentrated dosage (1.62% vs. the prior 1%). That dosage got FDA approval in 2011 and extends patent protection until 2015. ""The 'IsItLowT' campaign was designed to raise awareness of low testosterone among men who may be at risk or have the condition,"" explains Jim Hynd, divisional VP, metabolics, GI and cardiovascular care, AbbVie. Hypogonadism affects about 14 million men in the US alone, but less than 10% are currently being treated for the condition, adds Frank Jaeger, director, men's health, AbbVi e. ""We f e l t something needed to be done to educate men about this condition."" The same goals led to the development of another initiative, ""Drive for Five,"" urging men to know their T levels, in addition to lipid, BP, blood sugar and PSA numbers. It didn't hurt that baby-boomers have proven less than shy about availing themselves of any product that they believe will increase their quality of life. AndroGel thrived, at least in part, due to the intersection of demographics and demand. Yet complications came from AndroGel's corporate past. Since 2000, AndroGel had three owners: Unimed Pharmaceuticals, which was swallowed up by Solvay Pharmaceuticals, which Abbott purchased in 2010. Also, a published report says there remain allegations and litigation claiming that AndroGel was marketed off-label for years; AbbVie is not accused of any wrongdoing. But the campaign's empathetic approach and consumer-friendly language resonate with the target audience. According to IMS Health, in 2011 AndroGel held nearly 49% market share in its category. In 2012, AndroGel passed the $1 billion sales mark in nine months (a 20% jump over the year-ago period), with 3.3 million scripts dispensed, an 18% jump. More educational efforts are in the works. ""The real electrifying moment,"" shares Hynd, ""is when you see the campaign start to make a difference for patients.

An ultrarare success story,Awards & honors; Pharmaceutical industry; Corporate profiles; Advertising campaigns,Name: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc; NAICS: 325412,Medical Marketing and Media; New York,1/1/13,"Medical Sciences, Pharmacy And Pharmacology, Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing",Trade Journals,Feature,"Alexion's Soliris, a drug which has won awards for medical innovation, has earned its commercial stripes, too. At press time, the biologic was on track to cross a billion dollars in worldwide sales. That's not so rare among therapies that, like Soliris, treat extremely obscure ailments and cost $200,000 or more per patient per year, but it's impressive considering the patient pool is just a few thousand. The drug, Alexion's first and only commercialized product, has helped push the company into the biotech big leagues with a market cap just shy of $20 billion, the sixthlargest behind names like Gilead and Amgen. Analysts expect Soliris to become a multi-billion dollar franchise. How it got to this point is a model for building a profitable ultraorphan brand. ""We're focused on developing and delivering therapies that transform the lives ultrarare and severe, life-theatening diseases-patients that without our therapies have no other hope,"" says Alexion's David Hallal, EVP, chief commercial officer. When MM&M caught up with Hallal in early December, his team was in the midst of launching Soliris for the second of its two indications, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), approved in late 2011. Approval for the first, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), was secured in 2007. ""In these settings, Soliris has a 100% response rate,"" he says. The US aHUS launch is progressing well, according to analysts, with European reimbursement for aHUS expected in mid-2013. Several other indications are set to follow. ""Our approach to aHUS was similar to that of PNH,"" notes Alexion's Jeroen van Beek, PhD, VP, global nephrology franchise, ""in that the focus is on disease education and establishing the importance and pathway to rapidly diagnose patients with aHUS so that they can receive the life-transforming benefits of Soliris."" In addition to a highly educated sales force calling on hematologists, nephrologists and renal transplanters, Alexion supports promotional programs where KOLs help teach physicians in the field. It also utilizes medical conferences, where its trade show booth focuses on early diagnosis and intervention. While the firm maintains a disease, brand and corporate web presence, its most important patientfacing effort, says Hallal, is its One- Source education and reimbursement program, in which Alexion's staffof registered-nurse case managers works one-on-one with the patient, family and HCP. ""It's really important to advocate for that individual patient and not necessarily attack all payers with a broader central message,"" he says. ""Among payers, their experience is usually with a few [PNH or aHUS] patients anyway."" Two-thirds of its business is ex-US, and the firm has secured public funding for Soliris in such jurisdictions as Australia and Canada-two countries well known for being perhaps even more restrictive than the EU. That's not a slam dunk given that the drug costs about $440,000 per patient per year (it's sometimes given away, in cases of hardship). ""Because the benefits of Soliris are transformative and not incremental, governments around the world...are recognizing the benefit,"" says Hallal. For instance, he cited research suggesting that PNH patients followed for up to eight years on treatment can expect the same life span as those of a normal population that are age- and gender-matched. If leftuntreated, PNH has a 35% mortality rate at five years. Says Hallal: ""This provides a very strong underpinning for our access strategy."" Disease awareness and diagnostic programs are set to increase, adds Margaret Olinger, VP, global hematology franchise, in order to ""positively influence the entire cycle of care."" PNH and aHUS are forecast to achieve global sales peaks of about $2 billion each, and with compelling evidence of Soliris efficacy in other indications, it could reach up to $8 billion in peak sales, according to Barclays Research.

Transcept/Purdue sleep drug's DTC blitz,Pharmaceuticals; Consumer advertising; Demand,Name: Purdue Pharma LP; NAICS: 325412; Name: Transcept Pharmaceuticals Inc; NAICS: 325412,Medical Marketing and Media; New York,1/1/13,"Medical Sciences, Pharmacy And Pharmacology, Business And Economics--Marketing And Purchasing",Trade Journals,News,"Facing lower-than-expected demand for sleep drug Intermezzo, Purdue Pharma and Transcept Pharmaceuticals are broadening their commercial strategy to include DTC and a larger selling force. Intermezzo is a sublingual version of Sanofi's blockbuster insomnia pill Ambien (zolpidem). But the new formulation, approved in November 2011 and introduced earlier this year, has had a lethargic launch. Hence, the firms are rolling out a $29-million DTC ad campaign and, for the first time, tapping into Purdue's analgesics sales force of 525 reps to call on PCPs and retail pharmacies. One thing Transcept and Purdue don't have to worry about, management said, is facing multiple branded campaigns-at least not for another 12 months or so, which is when Merck expects to hear from the FDA on its novel sleep drug suvorexant. ""The market has been fairly quiet,"" said Transcept president/CEO Glenn Oclassen on a December conference call. On the call, analysts expressed skepticism, with one saying Intermezzo has about the same package insert (PI) as generic Ambien. ""We're anywhere from a third to a sixth of the dose [of zolpidem],"" Oclassen countered. He noted that the drug's sublingual delivery, designed to create rapid absorption, is rapid enough that the PI advises patients to be lying in bed when they take it. Moreover, Oclassen added, physicians are consumers, too, and some of them will see the campaign's on-air, online and print ads. The TV spot and related collateral were available for view in December on microsite myintermezzo. com. The new marketing push is ""almost a re-launch of the product,"" said Oclassen on the conference call. Transcept's third-quarter Intermezzo royalty income came in $600,000 light, said Leerink Swann analyst Jason Gerberry. While total scripts in the quarter were 1.7 times greater than second-quarter levels, royalty income dipped 60% (from $500,000 to $200,000), wrote Gerberry, who has since lowered his forecast for royalty revenues as a result. -Marc Iskowitz The campaign for Intermezzo includes a website "

The winning partnership, dubbed Registries for All Diseases, will collect a $300,000 award for its plan to create ""a comprehensive, cross-disease registry to help accelerate translational research for over 1,000 diseases."" Partner orgs include Genetic Alliance, CFIDS Association of America, National Psoriasis Foundation and the Inflammatory Breast Cancer Research Foundation. ""By creating a patient-centered research network that spans many diseases,"" said Genetic Alliance chief Sharon Terry, ""people will be empowered to participate in their own health."" The contest, which drew 128 entries from 280 different organizations, was administered by Sanofi's Partners in Patient Health unit (formerly known as its patient advocacy group). The Collaborate Activate challenge is similar to Sanofi's Data Design Diabetes challenge, in which teams of techies develop data-centric technologies that advance diabetes care. That contest is entering its third year. ""The health problems of patients and of the nation are too great for any one organization to solve,"" said Eric Racine, PharmD, MBA, who is VP of Partners in Patient Health at Sanofi.
